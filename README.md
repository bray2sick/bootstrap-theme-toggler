# Bootstrap Light/Dark Mode Toggle Example

This is a simple example showing how to use Bootstrap 5.3's built-in Light/Dark mode toggle.

Bootstrap includes a color mode (Light/Dark) toggle button in many of their examples, but they don't show how to implement the functionality behind it. This project fills that gap with a working demo.
